                    My name is Mike Skowron. I'm from Tucson Az, and I'm 30 years old. I am currently enrolled at the University of Arizona coding bootcamp.
                    Although I have less than 6 months of coding experience, I intend to absorb as much knowledge as possible and leave this class, a competent coder and web developer.
                    My current background is in retail, where I have worked the past 10 years, building my people skills and work ethic.
                    What I enjoy most about coding so far is seeing my vision take form and solving problems along the way.
